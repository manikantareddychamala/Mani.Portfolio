# 1.Real estate prices using linear regression and support vector machine in machine learning


# Linear Regression:

Linear regression is a simple yet powerful technique used for predicting a continuous variable based on one or more independent variables.
In the context of real estate prices, you could use linear regression to predict the price of a house based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, etc.

# Support Vector Machines (SVMs):

SVMs are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
In regression, SVM tries to find a hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes while maximizing the margin (distance) between the hyperplane and the data points.
In real estate, SVM regression can be used similarly to linear regression to predict house prices based on various features.

# Collaborative Filtering: 
This approach recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users or items. You can use techniques like user-based collaborative filtering or item-based collaborative filtering.
# Content-Based Filtering:

This approach recommends movies based on the similarity between the attributes of movies and the user's preferences. Features like movie genres, actors, directors, etc., are used to 
# compute similarity scores.
Hybrid Methods: Combine collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to improve recommendation quality.
