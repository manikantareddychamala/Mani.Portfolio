1.Real estate prices using linear regression and support vector machine in machine learning
# Description:

# Linear Regression:

Linear regression is a simple yet powerful technique used for predicting a continuous variable based on one or more independent variables.
In the context of real estate prices, you could use linear regression to predict the price of a house based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, etc.

# Support Vector Machines (SVMs):

SVMs are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
In regression, SVM tries to find a hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes while maximizing the margin (distance) between the hyperplane and the data points.
In real estate, SVM regression can be used similarly to linear regression to predict house prices based on various features.
